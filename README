Hello there,

This is my first attempt of coding in Rust.

This small commandline programme takes the following inputs:

--ip '<phrase>'
--if '<filename>'
--help

With the two inputs, its creates a seed which can be used to create a wallet.

Let me know if you have any feedback, happy to learnn from my mistakes.
