Hello there,

This is my first attempt of coding in Rust.

This small commandline programme takes the following inputs:

--ip '<phrase>'
--if '<filename>'
--help

With the two inputs, its creates a 24 word BIP39 seed phrase which can be used to create a wallet.

Let me know if you have any feedback, happy to learn from my mistakes.

Best regards,

City028
