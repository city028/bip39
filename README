Command line tool to create a BIP39 seed phrase from a phrase or file

Hello there,

This is my first attempt of coding in Rust.

This small commandline programme takes the following inputs:

--ip '<phrase>'
--if '<filename>'
--help

With one of the two inputs, it creates a 24 word BIP39 seed phrase, either from a phrase or a file, which can be used to create a wallet.

Let me know if you have any feedback, happy to learn from my mistakes.

Best regards,
